# Khalti Payment Gateway Core

Note: _This is an alpha release of the package and the APIs might slightly change with the stable release._

The core package for Khalti Payment Gateway that handles client requests. This package should not be used 
directly unless developer wants low level access to the APIs. For most cases, prefer using either [khalti](https://pub.dev/packages/khalti) 
or [khalti_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/khalti_flutter), which is a high level wrapper over this core package.
